Download `main.jar` (with `https://github.com/epic-pigeon/bomb_solver/raw/main/main.jar`on a lab machine, it only works on linux) and run
```java -jar main.jar --help```, or alternatively download `main.kt`, inspect it for spyware (of which there is probably none), compile with ```sudo kotlinc main.kt -include-runtime -d main.jar``` and run ```java -jar main.jar --help```
